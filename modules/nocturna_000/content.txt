[CENTER][COLOR:neon_blue]Prologue[/COLOR]

[PAUSE:500]

A screen flickers.  
Neon blues and pinks bleed into the dark.  
The chat explodes instantly.  
They have been waiting.  
They always wait.  
[PAUSE:700]  
And then—  

Lips.  
Soft. Wet. Glossy.  
A sheen that catches the light just right—  
Like they were made to be looked at.  
[PAUSE:600]  
Made to be wanted.  
[PAUSE:600]  
Made to make you wonder how they’d taste.  

[PAUSE:1000]  

But you don’t get to wonder for long, because then—  

She leans in.  
[HOOK:vesper_sigil]
Soft, wet, glossy pink lips purse into a smirk.
She looks at you.  
The kind of look that you feel.  
[PAUSE:300]  
That fraction of a second when your pulse stutters.  
When your breath goes tight in your throat.  
When every inch of your nervous system lights up like a goddamn neon sign.  

[PAUSE:500]  
It isn’t an accident.  
It isn’t coincidence.  
It’s intent.  

She knows exactly what she’s doing.  
And worse?  
She knows that you know.  

It’s in the slow blink.  
The barely-there tilt of her head.  
The way she lets the moment stretch just long enough—  
Long enough for the tension to coil.  
Long enough for you to forget that you weren’t supposed to be looking in the first place.  

[PAUSE:1000]  

And then?

Then she smiles.  

[COLOR:neon_blue]"Aww… look at you. Waiting for me like good little dogs."[/COLOR]  

[HOOK:simps]
The chat is frantic.

❖ MOMMY???  
[COLOR:neon_blue]❖ VESPER NOTICE ME PLEASE[/COLOR]  
❖ Holy shit she’s real.  
❖ Step on me.  

She tilts her head.  
Tongue gliding over a canine.  

[COLOR:neon_blue]"Mmm… I don’t know. Do you deserve it?"[/COLOR]  

The camera zooms in slightly.  
A shift in lighting.  
A deliberate tease of collarbone, the whisper of lace beneath the sheer black.  

❖ YES GOD PLEASE  
❖ MOMMY???  
❖ TELL ME WHAT TO DO  

She giggles.  
Pure poison.  

[COLOR:neon_blue]"Of course you do."[/COLOR]  

She sighs.  
Stretching languidly.  
Deliberately.  
Lets them ache for a flash of something more.  
Lets them starve for a touch that will never come.  

They do not deserve her.  
But they will pay.  
And they will beg.  

[COLOR:neon_blue]"Oh?"[/COLOR]  
[COLOR:neon_blue]"You want me to talk to you?"[/COLOR]  
[COLOR:neon_blue]"You want me to notice you?"[/COLOR]  

A long, slow blink.  
Pink and black hair tumbles over one shoulder—  
Framing her face like something crafted for obsession.  

[COLOR:neon_blue]"Then let’s play a game."[/COLOR]  

She holds up two fingers.  
A single black nail taps against her bottom lip.  

[COLOR:neon_blue]"Two options. I can talk to you…"[/COLOR]  
[PAUSE:1000]  
[COLOR:neon_blue]"Or I can disappear for another week."[/COLOR]  

The chat goes feral.  
❖ TALK TO US PLEASE  
❖ NO GOD NO  
[COLOR:neon_blue]❖ VESPER I’LL DO ANYTHING[/COLOR]  

She hums.  

[COLOR:neon_blue]"Hmm… I don’t know…"[/COLOR]  
[PAUSE:1500]  
And then—  
She clicks her tongue.  
Light catches her eyes, leaving a glow of neon pink.  

[COLOR:neon_blue]"Time’s up."[/COLOR]  

[GLITCH:short]

[SCENE:cut_to_binary]

A dimly lit tech den.  
Cables snake across the floor like living veins.  
Monitors hum, reflecting the flicker of the dead stream.  

A woman lounges in a chair, arms folded behind her head.  
[HOOK:binary_watch][COLOR:cyan]Binary.[/COLOR]  

She watches the black screen like a cat watches a goldfish bowl.  
"You are so fucking extra."  

She chews lazily on an old stim-gum, blowing a bubble.  

[HOOK:footprint][COLOR:neon_blue]On the desk—Vesper’s analytics.[/COLOR]  
❖ Viewership: 4.2 Million.  
❖ Donations: Staggering.  
❖ Digital footprint? Practically untraceable.  

She exhales. Reaches for her drink.  
"Like, really. Could’ve just said ‘Hey guys, what’s up?’ but nah.  
Gotta emotionally waterboard the simps first."  

The chat is still rolling.  
Even in darkness.  
Even without her.  

Like rats in a cage.  
Pavlov’s Bell.  

[COLOR:cyan]Binary’s fingers drum against the desk.[/COLOR]  
[HOOK:theory_thread]
"I give it fifteen minutes before some jackass starts a theory thread."


A ping.  
She glances at the holo-display.  

New messages.  
Same usual suspects.  

She scrolls.  
[COLOR:neon_blue]Half of them are begging to know when Vesper will be back.[/COLOR]  
The rest? Scrubbing for clues.  

The illusion is perfect.  
They believe they’re peeling back the layers.  
That they are this close to figuring her out.  

And yet—  
[COLOR:neon_blue]Vesper is already ten moves ahead.[/COLOR]  

[COLOR:cyan]Binary grins.[/COLOR]  
"Fucking art."  

She exhales.  
Tosses the mic onto the console.  
The mask is gone.  

[HOOK:mask_off]
She wipes off the gloss.

Rakes her fingers through her hair.  
Pink strands darken.  
The ratio shifts.  
Neon fades to black.  

She tugs off the thigh-highs.  
Reaches for a jacket.  

And when she stands—  
When she steps away from the camera—  

She is already changing.  

The e-girl is gone.  

Now?  
Now, the real problem starts.  

[HOOK:erebus_online][COLOR:neon_blue]Vesper steps out of the studio, into the streets of Erebus Prime.[/COLOR]  

The digital fantasy fades—  
And the real-world nightmare begins.  

Men notice.  
Women stare.  

She lets them.  

She knows exactly what they see.  

And that?  
That is how they will never see her coming.
